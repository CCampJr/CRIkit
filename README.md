###Summary ###
The CRIKit package offers utility methods for pre-processing coherent Raman spectral data. Currently,
this package contains a few key componenets:
* Phase retrieval via the Kramers-Kronig relation
* Asymmetric least square baseline detrending
* Asymmetric reweighted penalized least squares

These represent but a small fraction of our developed software. For more information, see the contact info below.

###Setup###

MATLAB: Download source code to a folder and add to MATLAB path via "Set Path"

Python: Download source code to a folder. Note: there is a IPython Notebook with the Python code. You may wish to place this
in your local IPython notebook folder for easy accessibility.

###Dependencies###

MATLAB: MATLAB 2013a or newer (it may work on older versions as well).

Python: (REQUIRED) Python >= 3.4; Numpy, SciPy. (RECOMMENDED) PyFFTW, CVXOPT (BETTER) or scikits.sparse.
